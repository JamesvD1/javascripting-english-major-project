      <br><p> This map of five points in New York City. The five points I visited are Washington Square Park, St Patrick Cathedral, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Flat iron Building. This is a map depicting “Must Visit Tourist attractions” when coming to New York City. I chose these five places because of their cultural impact and their popularity.  All pictures on each slide of the points were taken by me. Due to the immense  size of each site it was difficult to get a full image. I enjoyed traveling through the city to complete this project. I specifically chose these points because my grandfather used to take my sister and I on an “adventure in the city”. When he was alive we would first visit the Chrysler building, second St Patrick's Cathedral, third empire state , fourth Flat iron and lastly Washington Square park. I made sure when completing this project to follow the same order. We used to end the “adventure” with lunch in Washington Square park. I went with my sister to complete this project, it was fun for both of us to reminisce. 
The yellow point is St Patrick's Cathedral and I added a “religious-christianity” symbol to represent the church. The red , white and blue points all have a “building” symbol to represent the three towers. The green point has a “park” symbol because it depicts Washington square park.  .</p></br>
